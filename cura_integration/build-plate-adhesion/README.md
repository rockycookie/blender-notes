# Build Plate Adhesion

## Type:
- Skirt --> no adhension lines attached to the object, but the bottom surface will very likely not be flat, the corners might be lift up
- Brim --> adhension lines attached to the object, buttom surface almost always flat; the edge of the bottom surface would not be as clean as the Skirt printed objects even after cleaning

### Takeaway
Let's use Brim for now, maybe set the adhension line width smaller so that hoping the bottom surface edge would be cleaner after clean.

Maybe try out the other type Raft?
